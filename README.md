# Newsletter_project
This is a Newsletter signup project that uses mailchimp API to record subscribing members and was already deployed on Heroku server for others to use.
This project was done along the Full-Stack Web Dev course taken by Angela Yu on Udemy.com.
Files uploaded are all but the node modules folder since it has too many contents which Github does not allow.

Please refer to the link below to access the signup page deployed on Heroku server.
